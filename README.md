## Description

This repository contains the code and resources related to the paper titled **"Anomaly Detection of Botnets in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) Scenarios Integrating Homomorphic Encryption"**. The objective of this work is to present an innovative approach for detecting anomalies in Internet of Vehicles (IoV) scenarios using Homomorphic Encryption, ensuring data privacy while detecting malicious botnet activities.

## Introduction

The increase in connectivity and complexity of modern vehicles has brought new challenges for cybersecurity. Botnets in IoV scenarios represent a significant threat, requiring advanced anomaly detection methods that can operate efficiently and securely. This paper proposes the use of Homomorphic Encryption to protect data while enabling the necessary analysis to detect anomalous activities.

## Methodology

The proposed methodology combines anomaly detection techniques with homomorphic encryption to ensure that vehicle data remains private during the analysis process. The workflow of the study includes:

1. Collecting network traffic data in IoV scenarios.
2. Applying homomorphic encryption to the collected data.
3. Implementing anomaly detection algorithms on encrypted data.
4. Evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model.
